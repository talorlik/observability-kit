# Decisions Log

Durable record of non-obvious decisions, deviations, gotchas, and
follow-ups captured at the end of each batch run. Appended by the
`/run-batch` command (Step 6); manual entries are welcome. Newest entry
first. Entry format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD - Batch <ID or n/a> - <short title>

- Decision: <what was decided or discovered>
- Why: <reasoning, trade-off, or evidence>
- Follow-up: <action for a future batch, or "none">
```

## 2026-07-09 - Batch n/a - Adopt /run-batch and Wave-Based Execution

- Decision: added the `/run-batch` command
  (`.claude/commands/run-batch.md`), adapted from the
  claude-code-ai-coach-assistant repository, and optimized batch
  execution for multi-agent-driven development via
  `docs/auxiliary/task_execution/MULTI_AGENT_BATCH_EXECUTION.md`.
- Why: batches in `TASKS.md` carry explicit intra-batch dependencies, so
  independent tasks can run as parallel implementer agents in waves; the
  command makes batch runs hands-off, evidence-gated, and safe to run in
  fresh sessions. Baseline at adoption: all 15 batch smoke wrappers pass
  (`docs/reports/validation/` report of 2026-07-09).
- Follow-up: recompute a batch's wave plan whenever its `Dependencies`
  lines change in `TASKS.md`.
